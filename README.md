Hello,

This repository keeps track of my experiments with Python's API.

I'm particularly interested in generating meshes that look interesting.

Eventually, I want to experiment with the generative placement of meta balls to create organic-looking 3D shapes.

I then want to combine those shapes with noise-based displacement shaders to create coloring schemes that look life-like.

We'll see how it goes :)
